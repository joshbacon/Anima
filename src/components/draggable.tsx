// extend to store both grid/row span and size (for when snap-to-grid is on and off respectively)
// probably through it in localStorage too and read on load



// general notes
// - have fixed sizes when snap to grid is enabled
// - maybe a couple sizes for each or else you won't be able to rearrange at all
// - be able to resize dynamically when in free mode (snap to grid is off)
// * be sure to save the free form placement and grid arrangement so it's the same when the user switches between the two
